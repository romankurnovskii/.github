# Contribution Guide

Be nice and respect the maintainers' time. ❤️

Please read this whole thing. Most of this applies to any repo on GitHub. 🙏

## Contribute

Code is not the only thing you can contribute. I truly appreciate contributions in the form of:

- Fixing typos.
- Improving docs.
- Triaging [issues](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=user:romankurnovskii+is:issue+is:open&s=updated&type=Issues).
- Reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=user:romankurnovskii+is:pr+is:open&s=updated&type=Issues).
- Sharing your opinion on issues.


## Submitting changes

- Give the pull request a clear title and description. It's up to you to convince the maintainers why your changes should be merged.
- If the pull request fixes an issue, reference it in the pull request description using the syntax `Fixes #123`.
- Make sure the “Allow edits from maintainers” checkbox is checked. That way I can make certain minor changes myself, allowing your pull request to be merged sooner.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks
